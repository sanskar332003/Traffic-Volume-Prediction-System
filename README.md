# Traffic-Volume-Prediction-System

Overview
This project aims to predict traffic volume based on temporal features (hour, day of the week, weekend indicator) using various machine learning models. The system leverages Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Networks to analyze and forecast traffic patterns.

Features
* Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and extracts key time-based features.
* Model Implementation: Trains and compares multiple models to find the best-performing one.
* Performance Evaluation: Uses metrics like RÂ² score, MAE, and RMSE to assess model accuracy.
* Visualization: Plots actual vs. predicted values and feature importance using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
